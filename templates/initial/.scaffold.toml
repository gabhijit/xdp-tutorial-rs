Welcome to XDP Tutorial in Rust.

Project '{{name}}' setup with default workspace. Next step is to add one
or more tutorials to the project. You can start with some basic tutorials
using templates from the `templates/basic/` directory.

```
# For example to run 'basic-01' tutorial, run the following command
cargo xdp-tutorial add templates/basic/basic-01 {{name}}
```

When prompted for tutorial name - you can use name like `basic-01`.

This will setup basic code for tutorial. You can then edit the code to
complete the tutorial.
